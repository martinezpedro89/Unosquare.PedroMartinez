# Unosquare.PedroMartinez

This is a repository created for the prefilter challenge provided by Unosquare. 
here you can find an implementation of a repository pattern which is running operations (CRUD) over a list. 
In that way should be easy to replace the List for a DB context in SQL database, cosmosDB or other DB in the future.
